					<h4>Looking at the socioeconomic dynamics of marriage</h4>
				</div>	
				<p>In the growing discourse about income inequality in the United States, much has been made about the state of marriage: that it is becoming <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/10/26/marriage-and-the-growing-class-divide">increasingly concentrated among the well-off and well-educated</a> and that people are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/upshot/marriages-of-power-couples-reinforce-income-inequality.html?_r=0">pairing off with their socioeconomic peers</a>.  Just how strong is that effect?</p>

					<h3>What Jobs do Married Couples Tend to Hold?</h3>
					<p>Let's first take a look at what occupations tend to pair off together.  Using the 2014 American Community Survey, we can observe the jobs held by over 200,000 married couples.</p>
					<p>The heatmap to the right shows just how common (or uncommon) marriages are between different occupations.  Occupations are ordered such that those with high paid, high educated workers are located in the top-left corner and those with low paid, low educated workers are in the bottom right.</p>

					<h3>Income and Education Levels Between Spouses</h3>
					<p>Another way of examining the socioeconomic dynamics of marriage is to look at how spouses' income and education levels compare to one another.  Do people tend to marry those with similar earnings and educational attainment as themselves?</p>

					<h3>Now let's look at who's getting and married who is not.</h3>
					<p>First let's look at which workers tend to get married.  For these next few graphs, we'll focus on adults between the ages of 35 to 50 since most people will have completed their education, been working and gotten married.</p>
					<p>The graph to the right breaks down the percentage of workers within each occupational group who are married.</p>

			<div id="conclusion" class="row">
				<p>Marriage dynamics are certainly complex and cannot just be boiled down to numbers and statistics but it is an important topic worth studying due to the associations between marriage, poverty, and the well-being of children.  Who's getting married to whom can impact not only the well-being of the current population but also that of future generations.</p>
