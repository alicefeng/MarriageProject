# MarriageProject or Who's Marrying Whom?

This project visualizes data on the socioeconomic dynamics of marriage in the US by taking a look at the occupations found in married couples and how their income and educational attainment compare to one another.

You can find the code and data for my project here.  Code on how I created the data can also be found in the Data folder.
