# Surprise Marriages

This project visualizes patterns in marriages based on occupation.  It is inspired by the idea of using Bayesian Surprise to determine which pairings are particularly noteworthy and tries to explore properties of those marriages.  It also looks at which occupations are more likely to get married than others.

You can find the code and data for my project here.  Code on how I created the data can also be found in the Data folder.
